#dplyr, a useful package

Let me tell you about a package I like. It's called dplyr. 
Here's how you install and load it.
```{r, message = FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

Here are some useful functions in dplyr

```{r}
penguins <- penguins

#filter() allows us to select certain rows based on logical criteria
# %>% is the pipe in dplyr
penguins %>% filter(species == "Adelie") %>% head

```
