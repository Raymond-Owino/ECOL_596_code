# ECOL_596_code

### Resources for ECOL 596W: Practical and Reproducible Data Science for EEB
Here you will find readings, datasets, and scripts for the class. There are
three folders of interest:  

1. /readings: where pdfs of class readings are posted.  
2. /datasets: where .csv files of datasets that we'll be using in class will be used
3. /scripts: where scripts for in-class assignments will be placed

How to set up a class project for easiest use:  

*Option A)* If you are not yet familiar with git integration (don't worry, you will be by 
the end of this course!), create a directory on your home computer with the 
same file structure, i.e. a folder called "Ecol_596_code" and subfolders named
datasets, readings, and scripts. This project structure will streamline your 
analyses going forward.  

*Option B)* If you are already familiar with git integration, feel free to fork
the repo to your own github account and create a local copy for your own computer.
