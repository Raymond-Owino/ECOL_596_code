## R Markdown Example

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

This brief document provides an example of how you might use markdown. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
head(penguins)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "bill length x bill depth for three species of penguin", warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% ggplot(aes (x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, 
                         color = species, shape = species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "bill depth (mm)", y = "bill length (mm)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
